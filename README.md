# TXT files
These files contain the songs in a format similar to ProChords, but with some changes.
## Parts
Parts are signaled between slashes, e.g. `/verse/` indicates a verse part, and are placed at the beginning of the part.

## Chords
Chords are written between brackets, e.g. `[Am]`, and will be placed just above the text right next to it. For example in `Es[C]toy a la [G]puerta y [F]llamo`, the chord C is placed above the 'toy' syllable. One can write any possible chord, with no limitations, as long as no special characters are used

## Multiline
To make a line have two voices, the line must start with `{`
